# Snapdragon 626

Looks like a pin compatible predecessor to the Snapdragon 632 used in
the Fairphone 3.  Intrinsyc provides a compute modules named [Open-Q
626
Î¼SOM](https://www.intrinsyc.com/computing-platforms/open-q-626-system-on-module-som/)
and an accompanying [development
kit](https://shop.intrinsyc.com/products/open-q-626-development-kit)
for which some [technical
documentation](https://tech.intrinsyc.com/projects/open-q-626-dev-kit-public/documents)
is available.

## Android devices

The following Android devices use the Snapdragon 626 (with LineageOS
device name in parens):

* BQ Aquaris X ([bardock](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/bardock/))
* BQ Aquaris X Pro ([bardockpro](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/bardockpro/))
* Motorola Moto Z2 Play ([albus](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/albus))

## Bootloader

According to Intrinsyc's [bootloader reprogramming service
page](https://shop.intrinsyc.com/products/boot-loader-re-programming),
it's not possible to "reflash your bootloader on your own because
Qualcomm proprietary tools are required.".  This is very likely to be
true for the Fairphone 3 as well.

Some kind of secure booting seems to be at work, see:
